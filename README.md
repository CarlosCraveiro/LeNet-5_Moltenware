# LeNet-5 in a Moltenware implementation

It was once said that Hardware was nothing more than petrified software. However, in this repository we implemented a LeNet-5 using C language and FPGA, obtaining more performance (Hardware) together with greater versatility (Software), uniting the two worlds. Hardening the Software and Softening the Hardware, to something in between, like Molten Iron, so a Moltenware implementation.
